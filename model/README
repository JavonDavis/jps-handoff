1. Introduction

This repository contains Python code for extracting AMI data from
the ServiewCom web portal, training a Random Forest model based on
historical audit results, and calculating risk scores based on that
model. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

2. Setup

This code is intended to be run on a Microsoft Windows machine within the JPS
virtual private network, though it can readily be adapted to run on Linux or any
other platform with a Python interpreter.

A. Setting up the network drive
	 Within the JPS network, make sure the Z drive is mapped to 
\\jps-amiprod2, or edit the script and change the lines which specify
the SVC mount point. This is where the code will expect to find the ServiewCom AMI 
data dumps, and will store its own saved AMI data.

B. Installing Python
	This code relies on the Python 2.7 interpreter as well as several
packages such as scikit-learn, pandas, and BeautifulSoup. The easiest way to
meet these requirements on a Windows machine is to download and install the
free Anaconda Scientific Python distribution:
	https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda

C. Setting up your Python environment on Windows
	Once Anaconda is installed, go to the Start menu and select
"Anaconda Command Prompt." Issue the following commands:
	conda create -n jps
	activate jps
	conda install pip 
		(proceed? y)
	conda install numpy
	conda install scipy
	conda install pandas
	conda install matplotlib
	pip install scikit-learn
	pip install mechanize
	pip install BeautifulSoup
	pip install six

	Now your Python environment is all set up. In the future, you
can simply go to the Anaconda Command Prompt and issue the command
	activate jps
to have access to all of the packages you have installed.

-------------------------------------------------------------

3. Running the code

All Python scripts can be run from the Anaconda Command Prompt after
issuing the "activate jps" command. Simply navigate to the appropriate
directory and type "python <<COMMAND NAME>>" where <<COMMAND NAME>> 
is build_model.py, generate_features.py, etc.

The work flow is as follows:

	* Assemble a list of historical audit results, including meter ID
          and loss-impacting status. An example file is included (subsample.csv).
	* Assemble a full list of meters for which you would like to calculate 
	  risk scores. Again, an example file is included (meter_list.csv).
	* Run the svc_dump_invest.py script to extract the AMI data for the
	  historical audits.
	* Run "generate_features.py --train" to turn the AMI data into features 
          for the Random Forest model.
	* Run build_model.py to train and store the model.
	* Run svc_dump_recent.py to extract the recent AMI data for all meters.
        * Run "generate_features.py" to turn the recent AMI data into features
          for prediction.
	* Run generate_predictions.py to use the stored model and extracted
	  data to generate a CSV file of risk scores.

## JPS large account non-technical loss detection
**Contact: tom@theimpactlab.co**

This code is the result of a World Bank-facilitated project undertaken 
by The Impact Lab and Jamaica Public Service. The goal is to decrease the
non-technical loss rate among JPS's large accounts. The primary output
of this project is the machine learning model implemented in the model/
subdirectory, which uses historical audit results and features derived
from AMI data to assign risk scores to accounts. A simple Django-based
web application is also provided for visualizing the data and the model
output. See model/README for additional information.

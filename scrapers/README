This file contains four scripts, each of which extracts some useful
data from ServiewCom. All expect to be run from within the Python 
environment described in ../models/README, i.e. they expect to have
some of the packages listed in the repository's requirements.txt file.

1. meterlist_scraper.py
	This is a useful and fast script that simply extracts a list
of all the meters tracked by ServiewCom. It puts the output in
meter_list.csv. Run it by typing "python meterlist_scraper.py". 

2. measurement_scraper.py
	This script extracts the most recent measurement and diagnostic
data for all of the meters in meter_list.csv (so you'll have to run
the previous scraper first!). It takes several minutes to run and outputs
the results in one CSV file called measurement.csv. This data can be
imported into the webapp using ../webapp/loaders/load_measurement.sh.
(Note that it's not a python script, so don't include "python" on the command
line.)

3. profile_event_scraper.py
	This long-running script extracts the AMI profile and event data
for the meters in meter_list.csv. You can edit the first few lines to adjust
the number of days of data extracted; by default, it gets the most recent
365 days of profile data and 30 days of event data for each meter. Expect
it to take at least a full day to run if you're getting this much data for
every meter.

4. profile_event_scraper_nightly.py
	This script is a slight modification of the above that is intended
to be run nightly and imported into the webapp using ../webapp/loaders/bulk_load.sh.
